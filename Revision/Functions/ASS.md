## Chapter 3 (Functions)

### Assignments

function addition(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

console.log(addition()); //You are not allowed to modify this line any more
```

**3.4:** Identify which **type** of value passed below into the function **greet()**. What will be the return value of greet ?

};

console.log(arrowFunction('Programmers'));
```

**3.8:** Create a JavaScript **Function** to find the area of a triangle where lengths of the three of its sides are 5, 6, 7. : **Area = Square root ofâˆšs(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)** where **s** is half the perimeter, or **(a + b + c)/2**.

```js
input: area_of_triangle(5, 6, 7);

output: 14.69;
```

**3.9:** Create a JavaScript **Function** to capitalize the first letter of each word of a given string.
